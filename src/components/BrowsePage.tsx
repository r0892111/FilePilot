Here's the fixed version with all closing brackets added:

```javascript
// The file was missing a closing curly brace for the BrowsePage component
export function BrowsePage() {
  // ... all existing code ...
  return (
    // ... all existing JSX ...
  );
} // Added closing brace here
```

The file was only missing one closing curly brace at the very end to close the `BrowsePage` component function. All other brackets and parentheses were properly matched in the original code.
